<h2> About Tony </h2>
<img class="pull-right" src="/assets/img/tonym.jpg"> 
<p>My name is Tony McGee and I'm a SQL Server Database Administrator and .NET Developer living on the sunny <a href="http://www.visitgoldcoast.com/" target="_blank">Gold Coast, Australia.</a></p>

<p>
I've been in the software industry since 2002, developing C++ based commercial encryption software. 
Later I joined a team tasked with maintenance and extension of a suite of custom CRM &amp; ERP applications in C#, first as a developer and then as Database Adminstrator (DBA).</p>

<p>
You'll find me outside of business hours either with an Xbox 360 controller in hand or experimenting with interesting scripting languages: PowerShell, TSQL, Python, Javascript or any combination.</p>
